# pocket-claude

**Use Claude Code from your browser, anywhere.**

pocket-claude is a web interface for Claude Code CLI. If you're using Claude Code, you can install this to get a browser-based UI instead of working in the terminal.

## What does it do?

Turn your Claude Code CLI into a web app:
- **Browse to a URL** and chat with Claude Code through a clean web interface
- **Use your phone or tablet** - especially optimized for iOS Safari
- **Access from anywhere** - via VPN, SSH tunnel, or local network
- **Keep conversations organized** - tab-based session management
- **Works with CLAUDE.md** - Respects your project's CLAUDE.md configuration

**This works for ANY Claude Code user:**
- On your local laptop - use browser instead of terminal
- On a home server - access Claude Code from your phone while traveling
- On a cloud VM - prefer web UI over SSH + terminal sessions
- **Project management** - Add project directories directly from the browser

**No server required** - Just `npm install` and run it wherever your Claude Code is installed.

## Features

- **Mobile-First Design** - Tested and optimized for iPhone Safari
- **Ultra-Lightweight** - Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step required
- **Tab-Based Conversations** - Manage multiple conversations simultaneously
- **Context Usage Tracking** - Real-time token usage visualization
- **Integrated History Browser** - Browse and resume past sessions
- **SSE Streaming** - Real-time output with automatic reconnection
- **Markdown Rendering** - Clean, readable output formatting

## Why pocket-claude?

Existing solutions are feature-rich but heavyweight. pocket-claude takes a different approach:

- **No React/Vite/TypeScript** - Just Express + vanilla JS
- **Self-hosted focused** - Designed for home server environments
- **iOS-optimized** - visualViewport API for perfect keyboard handling
- **Minimal dependencies** - Only marked.js for markdown rendering

## Quick Start

**Simplest installation (works with Claude Code):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarou0080/pocket-claude.git
cd pocket-claude
npm install
npm start
```

Access at `http://localhost:3333`

That's it! It works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults.

### Optional Configuration

**Add custom project directories** (`projects.json`):
```json
{
  "home": "/home/user",
  "work": "/home/user/workspace",
  "myproject": "/path/to/project"
}
```

**Change settings** (`config.json`):
```json
{
  "port": 3333,
  "permissionMode": "ask",
  "sessionDir": "./sessions",
  "logsDir": "./logs"
}
```

Copy from examples:
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
cp projects.example.json projects.json
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com/) installed and authenticated

## Project Management

pocket-claude allows you to manage project directories from the browser or configuration files.

### Add from Browser (Recommended)

1. Click the **P** button in the header
2. Enter project name and directory path
3. Click **Add Project**

Settings are persisted across server restarts.

### Manage via Configuration File

Edit `projects.json` to define projects:

```json
{
  "home": "/home/user",
  "myapp": "/srv/shell/myapp",
  "website": "/var/www/html"
}
```

### Add via Environment Variable

You can also add projects at startup using environment variables:

```bash
export ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_DIRS="/srv/shell:/opt/projects"
npm start
```

These are automatically added as `env_0`, `env_1`, etc.

## Configuration Options

### Permission Modes

- `"ask"` (default) - Prompt for tool execution approval
- `"bypassPermissions"` - Auto-approve all tool executions

⚠️ **Security Warning**: `bypassPermissions` mode allows Claude Code to execute tools without confirmation. Only use in trusted environments with proper authentication (e.g., VPN + 2FA).

## Architecture

```
[Mobile Browser]
    ↓ HTTP
[pocket-claude (Node.js/Express)]
    ↓ spawn
[claude CLI (headless mode)]
    ↓
[Your Project Directory]
```

- **Frontend**: Single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Express server spawning `claude -p` processes
- **Communication**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming
- **Session Management**: JSON files for persistence

## Security Considerations

pocket-claude is designed for **local/trusted network use**:

- **Local network only** - Runs on localhost or LAN by default
- **Permission mode** - Use `permissionMode: "ask"` for safer operation
- **Trusted environment** - Not designed for public internet exposure

For remote access, consider using a VPN or SSH tunnel instead of exposing the server directly.

### Environment Variables

Set `ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_DIRS` to allow access to additional directories (colon-separated):

```bash
export ADDITIONAL_ALLOWED_DIRS="/srv/shell:/opt/projects"
npm start
```

## Out of Scope

pocket-claude is intentionally minimal. The following features are **not planned**:

- **File editor** - Use VSCode or your preferred editor
- **Terminal emulator** - Use SSH or native terminal
- **Multi-user support** - Designed for single-user, trusted environment
- **Database integration** - Session data is stored in simple JSON files
- **Authentication system** - Rely on network-level security (VPN, firewall)

If you need these features, consider:
- [claudecodeui](https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui) - Full-featured web IDE
- [claude-relay](https://github.com/chadbyte/claude-relay) - More advanced features

## Troubleshooting

### Claude CLI not found
Ensure Claude Code CLI is installed and in your PATH:
```bash
which claude
```

### Permission denied errors
Check that your project directories are readable by the user running pocket-claude.

### SSE connection issues
If using nginx, ensure buffering is disabled:
```nginx
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_cache off;
```

### Port already in use
Change the port in `config.json` or set `PORT` environment variable:
```bash
PORT=3334 npm start
```

### Project directory not accessible
If adding a project fails:

1. Check if the directory exists:
   ```bash
   ls -ld /path/to/project
   ```

2. Check if you have read permissions:
   ```bash
   # Run as the user running pocket-claude
   cd /path/to/project
   ```

3. Check server logs for details:
   ```
   [WARNING] Invalid project path: myproject -> /srv/shell (No such file or directory)
   ```
